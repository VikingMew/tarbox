# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa crate - Marvin Attack timing vulnerability
# This is a low-severity timing side-channel vulnerability in RSA decryption.
# We ignore it because:
# 1. Tarbox doesn't directly use RSA operations
# 2. This is a transitive dependency (likely from tonic/rustls)
# 3. The vulnerability requires very specific attack conditions
# 4. Will be resolved when dependencies update
